The _Polyrice Candy_ installation uses an Arduino Uno to display [Polybius square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square)-encoded messages related to foods I had as a child growing up Chinese American (with family from Hong Kong) through illuminating LEDs embedded in fake rice candies. Messages presented by the candies include "ribena", "hawflakes", "eggtarts", "popiah", and "botanricecandy". A full list can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derekxkwan/polyb-brickhouse-install/master/text.txt).
