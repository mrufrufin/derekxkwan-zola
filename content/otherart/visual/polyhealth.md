 In my Polyhealth series of images, I used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to both chop up images related to several of my health issues (a shrimp allergy and glaucoma) and overlay visual representations of the [Polybius square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square) (an ancient Greek encoding scheme that associates letters with pairs of numbers) which encode thoughts and anxieties related to these issues. I also printed QR codes to display next to these printed images that link to animated versions hosted online.

In Polyshrimp, I address my adult-onset shrimp allergy and foods I can't eat anymore due to my shrimp allergy. Polybius square phrases include "seafoodgumbo", "meifun", "instantnoodles", and "wontonnoodles". In the background, a chopped up public domain shrimp appears originating [here](http://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=2676). The animated version can be found [here](https://derekxkwan.github.io/polyshrimp-p5/index.html).

 In Polyeye, I address my glaucoma, which I've had since my teens. Polybius square phrases include "youngestatthedoctor", "eyedropseveryday", and "eyelidassistance". The animated version can be found [here](https://derekxkwan.github.io/polyeye-p5/index.html).
