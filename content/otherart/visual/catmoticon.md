For _Catmoticon Portraits_, I used Python to detect the brightness levels in images of my cats and images of things I associate with them. I interlaced the images and represented dark areas of each image with representative emoticons. The Python scripts I used to generate these images can be found on my GitHub as [imgtextify-py3](https://github.com/derekxkwan/imgtextify-py3). 

In _Catmoticon Portrait No. 1_, I interlace a portrait of one of my cats I affectionately call "Big Cat" with a picture of a tomato I purchased at a supermarket a few blocks away (she has a taste for tomatoes).

In _Catmoticon Portrait No. 2_, I interlace a portrait of one of my other cats I affectionately call "Little Cat" with a picture of one of their mouse toys (she loves playing a "fetch" of sorts with mouse toys) and a waveform of hew meow (she has a high-pitched meow that really gets to me).
