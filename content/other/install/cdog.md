The _Chinese Dog_ series of images uses web technology to create an immersive visual experience and relate my personal experiences with racism. Using their smart phones pointed at two-dimensional "marker images" (images surrounded by a large black square) containing silhouettes, visitors are able to view the three-dimensional versions of these silhouetted objects, each of which was associated with a racist experience. On iPhones, quotes from these experiences including "Chinese Dog", "When did you come to America?", "Ni Hao!", and "Your English is good" scrolled across the three-dimensional models.
