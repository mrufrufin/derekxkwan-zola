The _Studious Overachieving_ series of images consists of autostereograms (computer-generated, two-dimensional images which reveal hidden three-dimensional images when the viewer alters their focus) embedded with text relating Asian American stereotypes. The texts embedded include "MODEL MINORITY", "STUDIOUS OVERACHIEVING", and "GOOD AT MATH". The technique used for generating the autostereograms is derived from "Displaying 3D Images: Algorithms for Single Image Random Dot Stereograms" by Harold Thimbleby, Ian H. Witten, and Stuart Inglis.
